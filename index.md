# 1.01^365 = 37.78 0.99^365 = 0.026
While really just a simple mathematic rule (fraction multiplied onto itself will get smallerr, >1 raised to postitive integer will get bigger), these numbers are a remidner to me that that great change doesn't happen overnight. nstead, it is the cumulative effect of doing many small, intentional things, over time. Simply put; do something that makes you 'better' every single day, no matter how seemingly small it is.
