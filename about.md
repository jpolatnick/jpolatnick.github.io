My name is Sacha McElligottâ€”welcome to my website! 


I was born in London to a musician and a photographer, and moved to San Francisco with my mom when I was 6. I have always been fascinated by unknowns and challenges. For a long time I was torn by my many interests and as an adolescent I went to the [Paul Green School of Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Green_(musician)#The_Paul_Green_School_of_Rock_Music), played concerts with my band, focused heavily on my art and chess, skied, and made skateboarding videos with my friends (see: [Other interests](https://sachaker.github.io/other)).
       
       
My fascination with unknowns and challenges continues to fuel me. On the professional front, I'm a Data Analyst at [NEO.LIFE](https://neo.life) and am responsible for building pipelines to collect, store, and analyze data, as well as automating workflows where possible. I also contribute content for newsletters and other media on the platform, which I love.
       
       
I hope you enjoy the site, making it has been a fun project on its own.
