My name is Sacha McElligott and I graduated from NYU in January 2019 with a BS Neural Science with a joint minor in Comp Sci and Math. Shortly after, I was named a 2019 recipient of the National Science Foundation's [Graduate Research Fellowship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSF-GRFP), but did not accept and continued my research at UCL under Dr. Michael HÃ¤usser. 



I was born in London to a musician and a photographer, and moved to San Francisco with my mom when I was 6. I have always been fascinated by unknowns and challenges. For a long time I didn't know what I wanted to pursue professionally and as a young adolescent I went to the [Paul Green School of Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Green_(musician)#The_Paul_Green_School_of_Rock_Music), played concerts with [my band](https://youtu.be/U6tYGmJI9ZY?t=133), focused heavily on [my art](https://github.com/sachaker/sachaker.github.io/blob/master/art.md), skied, and filmed skateboarders in SF.
       
       
       
I hope you enjoy the site, making it has been a fun project on its own.
