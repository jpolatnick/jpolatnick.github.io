My name is Sacha McElligott and I'm a Data Analyst at [NEO.LIFE](https://neo.life). 


I graduated from NYU in January 2019 with a B.S. in Neural Science and a joint minor in Comp Sci and Math. Shortly after, I was named a 2019 recipient of the National Science Foundation's [Graduate Research Fellowship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSF-GRFP), but did not accept and continued my research at UCL under [Dr. Michael HÃ¤usser](https://www.google.com/search?q=michael+hausser&oq=michael+hausser&aqs=chrome..69i57.1759j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). 



I was born in London to a musician and a photographer, and moved to San Francisco with my mom when I was 6. I have always been fascinated by unknowns and challenges. For a long time I was torn by my many interests and as an adolescent I went to the [Paul Green School of Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Green_(musician)#The_Paul_Green_School_of_Rock_Music), played concerts with my band, focused heavily on my art, skied, and filmed skateboarders in SF (see: [Other interests](https://sachaker.github.io/other)).
       
       
My fascination with unknowns and challenges continues to fuel me. On the professional front, I am currently looking to wield the analytical skillset I developed from years of competitive neuroscience research in new and exciting domains.
       
       
I hope you enjoy the site, making it has been a fun project on its own.
