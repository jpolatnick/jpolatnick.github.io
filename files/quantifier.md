# The Problem
#### [Immunohistochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry) is a high-specifity method that uses tagged antibodies to identify proteins in tissue. This method enables the use of fluorescent markers that glow when bound to the target protein and allow researchers to visualize the expression of the protein in the given tissue. Despite the popularity of this method, tools for quantifying structures remain largely inaccessible and researchers typically quantify the stained structures manually (loose estimation is much more common than anyone will readily admit), which is a burden on both the researcher's time as well as the integrity of their data.

# The Solution
#### To avoid this task, I built a system that would identify and count structures from images of our stained tissue.
