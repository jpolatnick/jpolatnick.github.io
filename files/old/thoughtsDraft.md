# **Humanity has already found the neural seat of consciousness, science has just overlooked it**

If someone put a gun to my head and made me blurt out the part of the brain that houses consciousness<sup>†</sup>, I'd say "thalamus" without breaking a sweat.

[The thalamus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK542184/) is a chunk of gray matter found in the forebrain. This is the Grand Central of the brain—it receives input from a vast number of areas and its projections innervate almost all sections of the cerebral cortex. The result: the thalamus both integrates and distributes information from countless areas. For instance, if sensory input comes in, the thalamus works its magic (transforms that sensory information along some dimension), and then spits it back into the sensory area from whence it came.

I believe quite strongly that anticipation is an evolutionary prerequisite for consciousness and that it demands the coordinated integration of the senses. This integration is crucial, just think about it: let's say a person is swinging a punch at you. Well, first of all, you would need to calculate the trajectory of their swing ([motor cortex](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0191480)) which would require that you visualize their fist reaching your face ([visual cortex](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4595480/)). Significance is assigned to avoiding their fist reaching your face because you know that it will hurt ([nociceptors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964977/)). All of this activity coming from disparate regions of your brain before the fist has even come near your face. Without the tight and timely integration of all the information, you can bet that tomorrow you'd wake up with a black eye... 

Why is anticipation a requisite for consciousness? Anticipation is birthed from expectation, and expectation requires:
- An internal, updatable model of the world (think: [Bellman Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation))
- A sense of futurity (not just living in the *now*, but in the *next*)
- Pattern identification (I would feel pretty comfortable positing that this is the product of the other two)

If we could find regions in the brain that encode or enable these, then I'd say we are well on our way to uncovering the secrets of consciousness.

Back to the thalamus... Considering that it receives and redirects so much diverse input to high-level (I hate that term) centers (and this term), how in the world has this not been investigated in the context of consciousness or cognition? I think this might be because of politics. Not the Washington D.C. kind, but the ever-present contention between generations of scientists. Great leaders of each generation (maybe there are bound to be fewer, per [Collison and Cowen](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/)) expand on the field's fundamental understanding of a phenomenon and in turn often unhinge discoveries made by previous generations. Sometimes this process of unhinging intersects within a generation ([Ramon y Cajal vs. Golgi](https://blog.eyewire.org/ramon-y-cajal-vs-golgi-a-neuroscience-rivalry/) was one of the greatest intellectual rilvalries in neuroscience). Crucially, individuals and scientific communities are influenced deeply by egos and the perception of fundamental truths—people are unwilling to accept novel discoveries if they fly in the face of what the scientists fundamentally believe to be true (or if they spent most of their life committed to that which is being overturned).

This time *really* back to the thalamus... Just based on sheer connectivity, it seems like the thalamus has always been a prime candidate for understanding neural processes on a fundamental level. Why has it taken so long for focus to shift to the thalamus? The thalamus has historically been viewed as a "low-level" (yuck!) center (yuck yuck!!), as part of a contrived framework of anatomical hierarchy in the brain. Everyone learns in their 101 courses that "the midbrain is the lower brain... and the thalamus and associated areas are part of the limbic system" ([here](https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/human-brain/brain5.htm), [here](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/teachereducationx92x1/chapter/lower-level-structures-of-the-brain/), [here](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/where-addiction-meets-your-brain/201404/your-lizard-brain), and [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/health-and-medicine/executive-systems-of-the-brain/emotion-lesson/v/emotions-limbic-system)). The fact that they peddle this crap to unwitting freshmen is infuriating! "Experts" loooove to talk about the limbic system, also called your "Lizard Brain" (yes, experts literally call it that). These experts have grouped the thalamus in this category based on the antiquated idea that neural anatomy recapitulates the evolutionary development of the brain. In plain English: the deepest parts of the brain are the ones most like our evolutionary ancestors. As an unfortunate consequence of this antiquated school of thought, the thalamus has unfairly been identified as a primitive area, with little historical investigation into its role in cognition!


[Mike Halassa](http://halassalab.mit.edu/) at MIT is one of the few scientists who gets it. He's still young in his career but I am willing to predict that he will be one of the aforementioned pioneers of his generation that will unhinge our current understanding of the brain (also see [Doris Tsao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_Tsao) and more recently, [Steve Ramirez](http://theramirezgroup.org/team/steve-ramirez)). If you're looking for a good read on the thalamus and cognition, his paper [Schmidtt et al. 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22073) is seminal. In brief, the paper demonstrates that thalamic neurons engage in task-dependent computations that freely transition from object-based to task-based. This means that the thalamic neurons can encode the identity of specific stimuli *as well as* their significance. Importantly, these thalamic neurons were found to regulate activity in the pre-frontal cortex (PFC), which is largerly seen as the most significant center for cognition. This means that the "low-level" area was not merely relaying basic sensory information from the PFC, but in fact was responsible for conferring its cognitive flexibility!

Mike and I had a great discussion last November about this fundamental oversight in the field and how overwhelming the evidence is for the thalamus' role in cognition. I am super excited to know that this fundamental transition in the field of neuroscience is imminent, and will be keeping a close eye on it all.

>**Bonus:** Google Trends for "[thalamus](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2007-04-09%202020-04-09&geo=US&q=thalamus)" (I promise this won't be my only data source) shows an incredible periodicity with annual maxima every October going back to 2007. Can you guess why? :)
