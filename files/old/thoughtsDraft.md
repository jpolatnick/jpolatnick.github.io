# **My take on the COVID-19 market**

People have been scared.


It makes sense, how could you not be when there exists the incessant echo chamber that is contemporary media? Call it ignorance, but I usually never listen to stock recommendations or follow markets through any particular media outlet. My investment approach could not be simpler: I think about the market, I substantiate or uproot my hypothesis with market data, and update my internal model of that market using these data.


A reasonable response would be to laugh. *What the hell do you know, punk?* Well, not much, but enough to consistently beat out some of the weirdest markets in the past 3 years and hold a constant >30% returns for that time. I have helped my family, other families, and my friends invest in the market, because at its best, it's a lot of fun. 


I'm no guru, I just love contrarian thinking. Thankfully, this translates well in investing: flying in the face of conventional wisdom, in late 2018, I shorted FB and AAPL based on a theory I had about their self-imposed pigeon holing. If this sound stupid, I encourage you to check out their stock prices for that year (P.S. I made >350% returns from those puts). Big money is made when you are right and the majority is wrong (see [Burry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry), [Dalio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Dalio), or [Soros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soros)). If everyone says I am wrong about a prediction, it's often my canary in the coal mine that encourages me to chase the idea further.


Back to 2020... COVID-19 has taken a huge chunk out of the economy, a chunk which is almost perfectly distributed across each industry. On March 10th, I was debating with my mom about this investment climate, as she was consumed by anxiety about the stock market and how the experts were saying it would be a recession (I remain pretty convinced that an imminent threat of such magnitude to the economy that's universally accepted as likely will in fact beget solutions that prevent it from actually materializing. These things really are reflexive in that way and every major economic recession has blindsided the majority, that's why they happen! That's probably for another blog post, though).


My mom, in line with the rest of America, was convinced that everything would plummet and that it would be a year for any of these stocks to rebound. I thought this all over... Just looking at the tech industry, it would make sense that hardware companies would be severely impacted—a lot of these tech behemoths got a cold splash of water exposing their overdependence on China (as if the [ongoing trade wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93United_States_trade_war) weren't enough). These hardware companies (e.g. AAPL, NVDA, AMD) now have to rethink their entire supply chain. The software companies (e.g. TWLO, OKTA, SHOP), however, should be much more nimble and unaffected by the downturn, right? Teams of programmers should still be able to deploy code from their bedrooms and people should still consume their products remotely.


As it turned out, the aforementioned industries (and individual stocks) were affected equally, and I just knew that the software stocks would rebound earlier. I'll let the data speak for themselves (green = software, red = hardware):


<img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="{{site.imgurl}}/img/stocks.png" height="80%" width="80%"/>


Now before you think that I retroactively changed my selection of stocks, these were the actual 3 that I recommended (I'm still invested in TWLO, and have been for years, but I sold off all my other stocks about 5 months ago when it became too time consuming).


These differences may seem slight, but the worst performing of my recommendations is 134% of the biggest return for the aforementioned hardware companies (TWLO returns are 519% of AAPL returns for this period!).


The point here is that intuition and calculated thought can be an important factor in distinguishing you from conventional opinion. Everyone else uses financials and the same old indicators—be different.
