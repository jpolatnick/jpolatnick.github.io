I spent the formative years of my life working in orchards for my family's dried fruit business. The rule was we had to work for 40 hours without pay to be eligible for employment by my uncle. My first 40 hours I spent tight rope walking up and down each row of the wooden drying trays making sure that each apricot was flipped with the open face towards the sun. As the years went by, I would eventually become a forklift driver, a harvest manager, a sales rep and ultimately a sales manager. My years in the fields and the unusual opportunities afforded to me at a young age taught me the value of hard work and gave me confidence to seek stretch opportunities in my future career.  

# **Intel** <img src="{{site.imgurl}}/intel.png" height="25" />
Age: 21-22

I spent a little over a year with Intel. I found myself on the Ethics and Legal Compliance team after taking a class in college on the ethics of the digital age that inspired me to pursue learning about AI and social robotics. I was lucky to have the opportunity to spend time at Intel thinking about how social aritificial intelligence would impact the future of our society. 

# **Instacart** <img src="{{site.imgurl}}/instacartcarrot.png" height="25" />
Age: 22-24 (present)

After finishing at Intel, I took some time to think, write and travel. At the time, I was obsessive over the venture capital industry, in particular [Sequoia Capital](https://www.sequoiacap.com/). I was fortunate to meet Sir Michael Mortiz, a legendary investor, and discover [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/) in 2018. Instacart was an exciting company that was growing quickly - 600 corp employees, 60k + personal shoppers across the U.S. In my first 2 years, I have managed some of Instacart's largest accounts and signed 80 new retailers that customers can now shop from on Instacart. I started at Instacart in a time when we had just began partnerships with many of the largest retail companies in the world, but didn't have the team built out to properly manage and grow the business yet. As a 23 year old, I again was exposed to unusual opportunities. I led our quarterly business review at the CVS HQ with our VP, I launched 180 pickup stores with Albertsons, and I managed three partners that have multi-billion annual revenues. For my next chapter, I am going back to account management to work on growing the business of our Costco partnership. Instacart now has over 1,400 corporate employees and 700k + personal shoppers. Most importantly, I am learning lessons about growing a young company that will be vital to my future endavours.
