I spent the formative years of my life working in orchards for my family's dried fruit business. The rule was we had to work for 40 hours without pay to be eligible for employment by my uncle. My first 40 hours I spent tight rope walking up and down each row of the wooden drying trays making sure that each apricot was flipped with the open face towards the sun. As the years went by, I would eventually become a forklift driver, a harvest manager, a sales rep and ultimately a sales manager. My years in the fields and the unusual opportunities afforded to me at a young age taught me the value of hard work and gave me confidence to seek stretch opportunities in my future career.  

# **Intel** <img src="{{site.imgurl}}/intel.png" height="25" />
Age: 21-22

I spent a little over a year with Intel. I found myself on the Ethics and Legal Compliance team after taking a class in college on the ethics of the digital age that inspired me to pursue learning about AI and social robotics. I was lucky to have the opportunity to spend time at Intel thinking about how social aritificial intelligence would impact the future of our society. 

# **Instacart** <img src="{{site.imgurl}}/instacartcarrot.png" height="25" />
Age: 22-24 (present)

After finishing at Intel, I took some time to think, write and travel. At the time, I was obsessive over the venture capital industry, in particular [Sequoia Capital](https://www.sequoiacap.com/). I was fortunate to meet Sir Michael Mortiz, a legendary investor, and discover [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/) in 2018. Instacart was an exciting company that was growing quickly - 600 corp employees, 60k + personal shoppers across the U.S. I started at Instacart at a time when we had just began partnerships with many of the largest grocery retail companies in the world, but didn't have the team built out to properly manage and grow the business yet. This afforded me many incredible opportunities early in my career. I got a chance to lead our quarterly business review at the CVS HQ in Rhode Island with our VP, launch 180 pickup stores when managing our Albertsons partnership, and parnter with executive teams at multiple multi-billion annual revenue companies to grow our business together. I then moved into the partnerships side of the business and managed to sign 80 new retailers that customers can now shop from on Instacart in the short 6 or so months in role. For my next chapter, I am going back to account management to work on growing the Costco partnership. Instacart now has over 1,400 corporate employees and 700k + personal shoppers. Most importantly, I am learning lessons about growing a young company that will be vital to my future endavours. 

# **ELB** <img src="{{site.imgurl}}/mslogo.png" height="25" />

I recently founded a board of young people to continue the fight against MS. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an unpredictable disease of the central nervous system that disrupts the flow of information within the brain and between the brain and body. Our group is the [Emerging Leadership Board](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11tzXD1Z4shJocRSgh1TWEdP8-wSTbGualI4QmdMEaZc/edit?usp=sharing) (ELB) and we are a branch of the [National MS Society](https://www.nationalmssociety.org/). Our mission is to create a sustaining involved group of young leaders to End MS. We are building a mentorship program, running our flagship volleyball and Climb MS events, and hosting all sorts of cool events to build awareness and raise money for MS. Please reach out to me if you ever want to talk more or be involved!
