## Traina Foods - The Family Business
Age: 14-20

I spent the formative years of my life working in orchards for my family's dried fruit business. The rule was we had to work for 40 hours without pay to be eligible for employment by my uncle. My first 40 hours I spent tight rope walking up and down each row of trays making sure that each apricot was flipped with the open face towards the sun for proper drying.

As the years went by, I would eventually become a forklift driver, a harvest manager, a sales rep and ultimately a sales manager. My years in the fields and the unusual opportunities afforded to me at a young age taught me the value of hard work and gave me a lot of confidence to seek stretch opportunities for myself in my career going forward.  

## Intel 
Age: 21-22

I spent a little over a year with Intel. I found myself on the Ethics and Legal Compliance team after taking a class in college on the ethics of the digital age that inspired me to pursue learning about AI and social robotics. I was incredibly lucky to get to spend my time at Intel thinking about how social aritificial intelligence would impact the future of our society. Intel was far different than the food industry and energy and excitement of starting young companies, and so I decided to look for something to jump onto that was moving really fast. 

## Instacart
Age: 22-24 (present)

Instacart was my lucky break. After finishing at Intel, I took some time to think, write and travel. I visited some family in Italy and thought long about my future. At the time, I was obsessive over the venture capital industry, in particular Sequoia. I was very lucky to meet Sir Michael Mortiz, a legendary investor, and discover Instacart in 2018. Instacart was an exciting company that was growing quickly -- 600 employees, 60,000 personal shoppers across the U.S.
