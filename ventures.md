# **Traina Foods (The Family Business)**
Age: 14-20

I spent the formative years of my life working in orchards for my family's dried fruit business. The rule was we had to work for 40 hours without pay to be eligible for employment by my uncle. My first 40 hours I spent tight rope walking up and down each row of trays making sure that each apricot was flipped with the open face towards the sun for proper drying.

As the years went by, I would eventually become a forklift driver, a harvest manager, a sales rep and ultimately a sales manager. My years in the fields and the unusual opportunities afforded to me at a young age taught me the value of hard work and gave me a lot of confidence to seek stretch opportunities for myself in my career going forward.  

# **Intel** <img src="{{site.imgurl}}/intel.png" height="100" />
Age: 21-22

I spent a little over a year with Intel. I found myself on the Ethics and Legal Compliance team after taking a class in college on the ethics of the digital age that inspired me to pursue learning about AI and social robotics. I was incredibly lucky to get to spend my time at Intel thinking about how social aritificial intelligence would impact the future of our society. Intel was far different than the food industry and the excitement of starting young companies, and so I decided to look for something to jump onto that was moving really fast. 

# **Instacart** <img src="{{site.imgurl}}/instacartcarrot.png" height="100" />
Age: 22-24 (present)

[Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/) was my lucky break. After finishing at Intel, I took some time to think, write and travel. I visited some family in Italy and thought long about my future. At the time, I was obsessive over the venture capital industry, in particular [Sequoia Capital](https://www.sequoiacap.com/). I was very lucky to meet Sir Michael Mortiz, a legendary investor, and discover Instacart in 2018. Instacart was an exciting company that was growing quickly -- 600 employees, 60k + personal shoppers across the U.S. In my first 2 years, I have managed some of Instacart's largest accounts and signed 60 new retailers that customers can now shop from on Instacart. My next chapter will be even more exciting, as I am going back to account management to work on growing the business of our largest partner. I have been lucky because I started at Instacart in a time when they needed people who were competent enough and willing to work hard. As a 23 year old, I was flying to Rhode Island with our VP for a quarterly business review at the CVS headquarters. I was in charge of the CVS account for 4 months because of a layoff... I was suppose to hold it for 2 weeks while they found the right person. Instacart now has over 1,400 corporate employees and 700k + personal shoppers. Most importantly, I have learned so many lessons about growing a young company that will be vital to my future endavours.
