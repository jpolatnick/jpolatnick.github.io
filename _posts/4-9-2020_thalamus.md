# **We've already found the neural seat of consciousness, science has just overlooked it**

If someone put a gun to my head and made me blurt out the part of the brain that houses consciousness<sup>†</sup>, I'd say "thalamus" without breaking a sweat.

[The thalamus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK542184/) is a chunk of gray matter found in the forebrain. This is the Grand Central of the brain—it receives input from a vast number of areas and its projections innervate almost all sections of the cerebral cortex. To be clear: the thalamus both integrates and distributes information from countless areas. As an example, if sensory input comes in, the thalamus works its magic (transforms that sensory information along some dimension), and then spits it back into the sensory area from whence it came.

I believe quite strongly that anticipation is a prerequisite for consciousness, and that anticipation demands the coordinated integration of several senses. Why anticipation? Because anticipation is birthed from expectation, and expectation requires:
- An internal, updatable model of the world (think: [Bellman Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation))
- A sense of futurity (not just living in the *now*, but in the *next*)
- Pattern identification (I would feel pretty comfortable positing that this is the product of the other 2)

Back to the thalamus... Considering its role in

>**Bonus:** Google Trends for "[thalamus](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2007-04-09%202020-04-09&geo=US&q=thalamus)" (I promise this won't be my only data source) shows an insane periodicity with annual maxima every October going back to 2007. Can you guess why? :)
