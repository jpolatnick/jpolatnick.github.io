The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. - Kobe

## Perspective

I find perspective to be the most important component of life and philosophy. 

# What is perspective?

Perspective is your understanding of self as it relates to life, the universe, spirituality or whatever you decide to believe in. Your perspective is the single most powerful tool for happiness, success, relationships and everything in between.

# How can we train our own perspective?

1. Learn to control your emotion
2. Experience the natural world
3. Understand the chance of life

**Control Emotion**
Marcus Aurelius and the philosophic thought of stoicism have been great intellectual resources that have aided my learning of controlling emotion (see 'books' for more).

Take this Marcus Aurelius quote for example, "Erase the false impressions from your mind by constantly saying to yourself, I have it in my soul to keep out evil, desire, or any kind of disturbance - this is the power nature gave you." This is from Aurelius "Meditations" - his personal journal for reflection. Aurelius is reminding himself that the mind is the derivitive of your decisions and feelings. The power that nature gives you is the ability to control those things. Practice controlling your emotions to further your morality. Controlling your emotion is a manifestation of applying perspective throughout your day.

**Natural World**
Actively seek cosmic synchronization; that transcendental experience that makes ego impossible and fear pointless. Cosmic synchronization is my fanciful way of talking about those moments when you experience a sunset over the ocean, the Uyuni salt flat during sunrise, the dolomites in the alps of Italy.... moments where the the serenity of nature is so moving that you enjoy peace and mental refreshment. 

**Chance of Life**
I was born in 1996. My parents met each other in San Francisco while working. My mom grew up on a farm and her grandparents immigrated from Italy. My father grew up in New York. My great grandparents all had the courage to risk never seeing their families to immigrate to a country where they did not know the language on the premise of "opportunity"...

I often think of one those lives - my grandfather. My grandfather was a front line medic in WW2. He was part of 8 people in his 156 person platoon to survive a German attack. He witnessed his best friends get shot on either side of him while a tree trunk saved his life. The next time he was shot, the bullet was directly over his heart. The bullet penetrated the metal cigarette case he was carrying in his shirt pocket, passed through the first layer and stopped at the back.

Statistical probablity. The probability that my grandfather survived WW2 x my parents meet in San Francisco x that I was born (I was a happy accident) = an extremely low number. But we if multiply that by the probabilty that a meteorite hit the earth 66 million years ago changing the environment to eventually sustain human life x the probability that my first two ancestors meet and the many "great great great.." grandparents after them... well then we have an extremely small number. But it we multiply that by the probabilty that 15 billion years a dense an extremely hot and dense cloud exploded into billions of suns and planets x the probability.... you get the idea, we get an infinetly small number.

The chance of life is nothing short of miracle. Always be grateful you have lived.

# Why is perspective the "most important component of life"?

Perspective offers you ability the to conquer fear and live unabashed. 

**Fear**
Why be afraid to do anything?

Somewhere up in space, a star has just used all of its combustible hydrogen. What remains is no longer supported by the heat of the combustion and collapses under its own weight to a point where it bends space to such a degree is it plummets into an actual hole￼. This is what we call a black hole...

When you are walking up to give a speech in front of thousands of people.. remind yourself that somewhere in space, a black hole has just formed. Center your mind in the rationale of how much of blink time is. And how little the judgement of this group of people matter in the greater scheme of your impact on the universe.

[Greatness Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=88&v=t2I3Yd27dGw&feature=emb_logo) This trailer gives a peak into athletes talking about how they perform under immense pressure... you'll hear Lebron say "I wish I could bottle nothing up."

Fear manifests from millions of years of biological instinct to protect your life. Perspective allows you to control how fear impacts your life. Use rationale of your mind to apply perspective in moments of fear to calm your biological instinctual fear. Then you breath out, and you conquer mind at ease.

Perspective allows you to access nothing whenever you want.

**Living Unabashed**
The Hubble telescope has shown from space a deeper image of the sky than any seen perviously.

<img src="{{site.imgurl}}/Hubble.jpg" height="200" />

Each black dot in the image is a galaxy containing a hubdred billion suns similar to ours. The majority of those suns are orbited by planets, meaning that there are thousands of billions of billions of billions of planets such as Earth. 

Thinking about the expansiveness of the universe helps me free myself from the need for validation from society. I can take any risk, approach any situation, talk to anyone, and be woever I want. Doesn't something like judging someone because they have different color skin seem pretty ridiculous if there are many billions of other planets around? 


# Time is like a river that carries us forward into encounters with reality that require us to make decisions. We can't stop our movement down this river and we can't avoid those encounters. We can only approach them in the best possible way.
