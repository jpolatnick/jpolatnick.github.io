The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. - Kobe 

## Perspective

Anyone who has had enough late evenings with me, usually accompanied by a bourbon, has had to sit through listening to my thoughts on this. I'll share them here because 'perspective' is an integral part of my life philsophy. I define perspective to be a person's understanding of self as it relates to life, the universe, spirituality or whatever someone decides to believe in. The strength of my perspective is informed by three things: Emotion, Nature and Chance.

**Emotion**

"Erase the false impressions from your mind by constantly saying to yourself, I have it in my soul to keep out evil, desire, or any kind of disturbance - this is the power nature gave you." This is from Aurelius "Meditations" - his personal journal for reflection. Aurelius is reminding himself that his own mind is the derivitive of his decisions and feelings. We are born with the ability to control those feelings and can actually train ourselves to improve that skill. The first step to controlling your emotion is to recognize how and when it affects you. An expert can feel the emotion of anger arising, understand if that emotion can positively or negatively impact that moment and any future decisions, and adjust her/his attitude accordingly. 

**Nature**

"Actively seek cosmic synchronization; that transcendental experience that makes ego impossible and fear pointless." To me this is really a fanciful way of talking about being in sync with the natural world around you. There is so much positive energy that comes from those moments when you are experiencing a sunset over the ocean, breathing in mountain air, feeling the soft grass and dirt of the earth with your bare feet.... moments when the serenity of nature offers you enjoy peace and mental refreshment. 

**Chance**
I was born in 1996. My parents met each other in San Francisco while working. My mom grew up on a farm and her grandparents immigrated from Italy. My father grew up in New York and his grandparents were also immigrants.

My grandfather was a front line medic in WW2. He witnessed his best friends get shot on either side of him while a tree trunk saved his life. In another German attack, he was shot and this time the bullet struck directly over his heart. The bullet penetrated the metal cigarette case he was carrying in his shirt pocket, passed through the first layer and stopped at the back. Our family has that cigarette case in our safe to this day.

I share all of this not to impress upon the reader the heroism of my grandfather, or the struggle that my gradfather endured, albeit I do love talking about him, but rather to show how lucky I am to be here. My grandfather is just one person in my lineage. And if we think a bit bigger, what about the probabilty that a meteorite hit the earth 66 million years ago that changed the environment to eventually sustain human life? Or that 15 billion years an extremely hot and dense cloud exploded into billions of suns and planets? The point being, that there is an infinite amount of time before me and after me, yet I am here able to live is nothing short of miracle.

# Empowering yourself with perspective

Fear can exert a suprising amount of control over our decision making. We are fearful of failure, uncertainty, change, judgement, inadequacy... the list goes on. Much of this fear is biological; it is porgrammed into your mind from millions of years of evolution trying to survive. In today's world, the ability to understand and manage your fear immediately seperates you from the vast majority of people. And controlling your fear, much like your emotion, is something you can train.

Somewhere up in space, a star has just used all of its combustible hydrogen. What remains is no longer supported by the heat of combustion and collapses under its own weight to a point where it bends space to such a degree, that it plummets into an actual hole￼. This is what we call a black hole.

When you are walking up to give a speech in front of thousands of people, think about a black hole forming for a moment. Center your mind in the rationale of how insignificant whatever you're doing is as it relates to time and space - the billions of years before us and the billions of years after us. Does the judgement of this group of people really matter at all?

[Greatness Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=88&v=t2I3Yd27dGw&feature=emb_logo) This trailer gives a peak into athletes talking about how they perform under immense pressure... you'll hear Lebron say "I wish I could bottle nothing up."

Find your own way to apply perspective in moments of fear to calm your biological instinctual fear... it's the same exercise as the classic adage of imagining the crowd in their underwear. 

Perspective allows you to access 'nothing' whenever you want.

Similarly to fear, we have a tendency to seek validation from society - a desire to be "normal" or "successful" in the eyes of others. What a ridiculous concept... your own happiness and the way you treat other people should surmount this. But it often doesn't and we all fall into the trap of allowing societal pressures inform what we think is best for ourselves.

The Hubble telescope has shown from space a deeper image of the sky than any seen perviously. Each speck of light in the image is a galaxy containing a hubdred billion suns similar to ours. The majority of those suns are orbited by planets, meaning that there are thousands of billions of billions of billions of planets such as Earth. 

When I notice myself getting caught up over what others think of me, I like to think about how many stars and planets are out there (getting a jist for how nerdy am I about space?) because it helps me free myself from the need for validation from society. This is really powerful because it allows you take risks freely and find your true maximums in happiness, potential, career and more.
