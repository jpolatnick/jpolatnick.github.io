_This section is written in the spirit of Kobe..._
"The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do." - Kobe 

## Some thoughts

My philosophy is simple: Be good and love your family, little else matters. How I put this into practice is more complex. Three themes have helped center my actions around my philosophy: Stoicism, Nature and Perspective.

**Stoicism**

"Erase the false impressions from your mind by constantly saying to yourself, I have it in my soul to keep out evil, desire, or any kind of disturbance - this is the power nature gave you." The quote is from [Marcus Aurelius](https://dailystoic.com/marcus-aurelius/)' "Meditations" - his personal journal while emperor of Rome. Aurelius is reminding himself that his own mind is the derivative of his decisions and feelings. Like a muscle, I've found that heightening my cosciousness of  emotional reactions to situations has helped me make better decisions that are line with my idenity. For example, you might feel envy seeing the success of a peer. Can we recognize this as an emotion? Can we evaluate whether this will positively or negatively impact any subsequent decisions or actions? Can we adjust accordingly? 

**Nature**

"Actively seek cosmic synchronization; that transcendental experience that makes ego impossible and fear pointless." To me this is really a fanciful way of talking about being in sync with the natural world around you. There is so much positive energy that comes from moments when you are experiencing a sunset over the ocean, breathing in mountain air, or feeling the dirt of the earth with your bare feet. Nature can offer moments of serenity that give your [Atman](https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/concepts/concepts_1.shtml) peace and mental refreshment so that you can in turn pass that onto others. 

**Perspective**

My parents met in San Francisco while working. My mom grew up on a farm. Her grandparents immigrated from Italy. My father grew up in New York and his grandparents were immigrants from Ukraine.

While a front line medic in WW2, my grandfather was shot by a Nazi in Normandy, France. He was carrying a metal cigarette case in his shirt pocket just over his heart that day. The bullet passed through the first layer and stopped at the back. Thinking only of the generations we can remember is enough to impress upon us the unquanitifiable improbability that you are you. No matter who you are, there is an infinite amount of time before us and after us, and yet we are here, able to live.

**Overcoming Fear**
Perspective, nature and stoicism have offered me a way to guide my decision making life. Equally important, having these tools helps me rationally overcome a challenge we all face: fear.

Fear can exert real control over our decision making. We fear failure, uncertainty, change, judgement, inadequacy etc. Fear can be biological, programmed into our minds from millions of years of evolution trying to survive. When I about to give a speech or take a big risk, it's almost investible that my heart will begin pounding faster. My brain chemistry will change, nerves will become present in my body and everything becomes scary. In these moments, I like to think about a black holes. Right now in space, a star has just used all of its combustible hydrogen. What remains is no longer supported by the heat of combustion and collapses under its own weight to a point where it bends space to such a degree, that it plummets into an actual hole￼ - a black hole.

Why? What I am doing is centering my mind in the rationale of how insignificant whatever I'm doing is as it relates to time and space - the billions of years before us and the billions of years after us. Does the judgement of this group of people really matter at all? It helps slow down my heart rate and I then I can calmly deliver the message I've practiced so much.

The [Greatness Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=88&v=t2I3Yd27dGw&feature=emb_logo)trailer is of atheletes talking about performances under immense pressure. Lebron says, "I wish I could bottle nothing up." 'Nothing' is the mental clarity that comes with being void of fear and doubt. Take a scientist approach to finding what works for you to calm your biological fear. I find that perspective has worked for me. It's really a similar concept that your Dad has probably told you when you were a kid about to perform in front of people - "Imagine the crowd in their underwear."

P.S. The Hubble telescope has shown from space a deeper image of the sky than any seen previously. Each speck of light in the image is a galaxy containing a hundred billion suns similar to ours. The majority of those suns are orbited by planets, meaning that there are thousands of billions of billions of billions of planets such as Earth... and that's just in this one photo! Unbelievable right... we might as well use our years chase dreams, tae risks and seek your true maximums in happiness and potential.
