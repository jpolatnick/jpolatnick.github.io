The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. - Kobe 

## Perspective

Perspective is the most integral component to my life philosophy. I want to share here how I look at perspective and the ways that I apply it to my life. I define perspective to be a person's understanding of self as it relates to life, the universe, spirituality or whatever someone decides to believe in. The strength of my perspective is informed by three things: Emotion, Nature and Chance.

**Emotion**

"Erase the false impressions from your mind by constantly saying to yourself, I have it in my soul to keep out evil, desire, or any kind of disturbance - this is the power nature gave you." This is from Aurelius "Meditations" - his personal journal for reflection. Aurelius is reminding himself that his own mind is the derivitive of his decisions and feelings. We are born with the ability to control those feelings and can actually train ourselves to be improve that skill. The first step to controlling your emotion is to recognize how and when it affects you. An expert can feel the emotion of anger arising, understand if that emotion can positively or negatively impact that moment and any future decisions, and adjust her/his attitude accordingly. 

**Nature**

"Actively seek cosmic synchronization; that transcendental experience that makes ego impossible and fear pointless." To me this is really a fanciful way of talking about being in sync with the natural world around you. There is so much positive energy that comes from those moments when you are experiencing a sunset over the ocean, breathing in mountain air, feeling the soft grass and dirt of the earth with your bare feet.... moments when the serenity of nature is so moving that you enjoy peace and mental refreshment. 

**Chance**
I was born in 1996. My parents met each other in San Francisco while working. My mom grew up on a farm and her grandparents immigrated from Italy. My father grew up in New York and his grandparents were also immigrants.

My grandfather was a front line medic in WW2. He witnessed his best friends get shot on either side of him while a tree trunk saved his life. In another German attack, he was shot and this time the bullet struck directly over his heart. The bullet penetrated the metal cigarette case he was carrying in his shirt pocket, passed through the first layer and stopped at the back.

Statistical probablity. That my grandfather survived WW2 x my parents met in San Francisco x that I was born (I was a happy accident) = an extremely low number. But what about the probabilty that a meteorite hit the earth 66 million years ago changing the environment to eventually sustain human life x the probability that my first two ancestors meet and the many "great great great..." grandparents after them... well then we have an extremely small number. But it we multiply that by the probabilty that 15 billion years an extremely hot and dense cloud exploded into billions of suns and planets ... we get an infinetly small number.

The chance of life is nothing short of miracle.

# Empowering yourself with perspective

Fear and validation.  

**Fear**
Why are we afraid? Afraid to push for a promotion? Afraid to speak in front of a crowd? Afraid to pursue our real passions? 

Somewhere up in space, a star has just used all of its combustible hydrogen. What remains is no longer supported by the heat of combustion and collapses under its own weight to a point where it bends space to such a degree, that it plummets into an actual hole￼. This is what we call a black hole.

When you are walking up to give a speech in front of thousands of people, think about a black hole forming for a moment. Center your mind in the rationale of how insignificant whatever you're doing is as it relates to time and space - the billions of years before us and the billions of years after us. Does the judgement of this group of people really matter at all?

[Greatness Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=88&v=t2I3Yd27dGw&feature=emb_logo) This trailer gives a peak into athletes talking about how they perform under immense pressure... you'll hear Lebron say "I wish I could bottle nothing up."

Fear manifests from millions of years of biological instinct to protect your life. Perspective allows you to control how fear impacts your life in today's society. Find your own way to apply perspective in moments of fear to calm your biological instinctual fear... it's the same exercise as the classic adage of imagining the crowd in their underwear. 

Perspective allows you to access 'nothing' whenever you want.

**Validation**
Why do we allow the judgements of 'others' to influence our largest life decisions?

The Hubble telescope has shown from space a deeper image of the sky than any seen perviously. Each speck of light in the image is a galaxy containing a hubdred billion suns similar to ours. The majority of those suns are orbited by planets, meaning that there are thousands of billions of billions of billions of planets such as Earth. 

Thinking about the expansiveness of the universe helps me free myself from the need for validation from society. Take any risk, approach any situation, create any relationship.
