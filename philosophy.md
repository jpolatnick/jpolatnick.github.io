The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. - Kobe 

## Perspective

Anyone who has had enough late evenings with me, usually accompanied by a bourbon, has had to sit through listening to my thoughts on this. I'll share them here because 'perspective' is an integral part of my life philosophy. I define perspective to be a person's understanding of self as it relates to life, the universe, spirituality or whatever someone decides to believe in. The strength of my perspective is informed by three things: Emotion, Nature and Chance.

**Emotion**

"Erase the false impressions from your mind by constantly saying to yourself, I have it in my soul to keep out evil, desire, or any kind of disturbance - this is the power nature gave you." The quote is from [Marcus Aurelius](https://dailystoic.com/marcus-aurelius/)' "Meditations" - his personal journal while emperor of Rome. Aurelius is reminding himself that his own mind is the derivative of his decisions and feelings. We are born with the ability to control those feelings and can actually train ourselves to improve that skill. The first step in controlling your emotion is to recognize how and when it affects you. An expert can feel the emotion of anger arising, understand if that emotion can positively or negatively impact that moment and any future decisions, and adjust her/his attitude accordingly. 

**Nature**

"Actively seek cosmic synchronization; that transcendental experience that makes ego impossible and fear pointless." To me this is really a fanciful way of talking about being in sync with the natural world around you. There is so much positive energy that comes from moments when you are experiencing a sunset over the ocean, breathing in mountain air, or feeling the dirt of the earth with your bare feet. Nature can offer moments of serenity that give your [Atman](https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/concepts/concepts_1.shtml) peace and mental refreshment. 

**Chance**

I was born in 1996. My parents met in San Francisco while working. My mom grew up on a farm. Her grandparents immigrated from Italy. My father grew up in New York and his grandparents were immigrants from Ukraine.

My grandfather was a front line medic in WW2. While in Normandy, France, my grandfather was shot at by Nazi's despite his medic status. The bullet struck him directly over his heart. I am alive today because of the metal cigarette case he was carrying in his shirt pocket that day. The bullet passed through the first layer and stopped at the back. 

I share this not to impress upon the reader the heroism of my grandfather, albeit I do love talking about him, but rather to show how lucky I am to be here. When I think about the statistical probability of recreating events such that my grandfather would live through the war, my mother would meet my father working in San Francisco, and I would come to be born (a happy accident), it makes me realize that my existence is the product of an infinite amount of unlikely events. What if the meteorite that struck earth 66 million years ago missed us entirely? The point here is that no matter who you are, there is an infinite amount of time before and after us, and yet we are here, able to live.

# Empowerment with perspective

Fear can exert real control over our decision making. We fear failure, uncertainty, change, judgement, inadequacy etc. Much of this fear is biological; it is programmed into our minds from millions of years of evolution trying to survive. Today, the ability to understand and manage your fear immediately sets you apart. Controlling fear, much like emotion, is something can be developed.

Right now in space, a star has just used all of its combustible hydrogen. What remains is no longer supported by the heat of combustion and collapses under its own weight to a point where it bends space to such a degree, that it plummets into an actual hole￼ - a black hole.

When I walk up to give a speech in front of thousands of people, I like to think about a black hole forming for a moment. I center my mind in the rationale of how insignificant whatever I'm doing is as it relates to time and space - the billions of years before us and the billions of years after us. Does the judgement of this group of people really matter at all? It helps slow down my heart rate and calmly deliver the message I've practiced so much.

[Greatness Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=88&v=t2I3Yd27dGw&feature=emb_logo) This trailer gives a peak into athletes talking about how they perform under immense pressure... you'll hear Lebron say "I wish I could bottle nothing up." 'Nothing' is the mental clarity that comes with being void of fear, judgement or doubt.

Find your own way to apply perspective to calm your biological fear... it's the same exercise as the classic adage of imagining the crowd in their underwear. 

Perspective allows you to access 'nothing' whenever you want.

Like common fears, most humans share a need for validation from society. Your own happiness and the way you treat other people should surmount this, but it often doesn't. We all fall into the trap of allowing societal pressures to inform what we think is best for ourselves.

The Hubble telescope has shown from space a deeper image of the sky than any seen previously. Each speck of light in the image is a galaxy containing a hundred billion suns similar to ours. The majority of those suns are orbited by planets, meaning that there are thousands of billions of billions of billions of planets such as Earth. 

When I notice myself getting caught up over what others think of me, I like to think about how many stars and planets are out there (yes, I am nerdy about space) because it helps me free myself from any need for validation from society. This is really powerful because it allows you take risks freely and find your true maximums in happiness and potential.

Emotion, nature and chance are three tenets that have built my perspective. I use perspective to overcome fear and appreciate what I have. Perspective is something that can be trained just like exercise can make you stronger and reading can make you more knowledgeable.
