# **We've already found the neural seat of consciousness, science has just overlooked it**

If someone put a gun to my head and made me blurt out the part of the brain that houses consciousness<sup>†</sup>, I'd say "thalamus" without breaking a sweat.

[The thalamus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK542184/) is a chunk of gray matter found in the forebrain. This is the Grand Central of the brain—it receives input from a vast number of areas and its projections innervate almost all sections of the cerebral cortex. To be clear: the thalamus both integrates and distributes information from countless areas. As an example, if sensory input comes in, the thalamus works its magic (transforms that sensory information along some dimension), and then spits it back into the sensory area from whence it came.

I believe quite strongly that anticipation is a prerequisite for consciousness, and that anticipation demands the coordinated integration of several senses. Why anticipation? Because anticipation is birthed from expectation, and expectation requires:
- An internal, updatable model of the world (think: [Bellman Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation))
- A sense of futurity (not just living in the *now*, but in the *next*)
- Pattern identification (I would feel pretty comfortable positing that this is the product of the other 2)

Back to the thalamus... Considering its role in

>**Bonus:** Google Trends for "[thalamus](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2007-04-09%202020-04-09&geo=US&q=thalamus)" (I promise this won't be my only data source) shows an insane periodicity with annual maxima every October going back to 2007. Can you guess why? :)

# **Brown Gold: How our poop is the most untapped gold mine of the 21st Century**

Poop, and by extension, wastewater, is a data source that will be replenished each minute of every hour of every day until the end of civilization. The microbiome is *severely* underappreciated in medicine and health<sup>†</sup>.
I've always been puzzled by this... The evidence supporting the significance of the microbiome is almost insurmountable ([Alzheimer's](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0227-7), [longevity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6051225/), [obesity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5082693/), [autism](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00198-y). The list goes on...), so how the hell could this be almost universally overlooked?

Most recently, [researchers discovered](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00973-x) that sewage water serves as a useful proxy for the extent of COVID-19 infections in the community. This made me wonder: why haven't we done this before?


What we have is a fundamental misalignment in the current and actual values of this asset (poop). Call it arbitrage or just plain old opportunity—the reality is clear. Wastewater is (literally) the shit that no one wants (well, [a few people](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/wastewater-treatment-water-use?qt-science_center_objects=0#)), and so starting to collect mass samples of wastewater wouldn't really perturb the existing system too much.


Despite all this, public interest in the microbiome seems to be stagnant:


<img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="{{site.imgurl}}/blogContent/googleTrends.png" height="250%" width="250%"/>


###### Okay, these might not be the most convincing data, but it's a start... Clearly the public appreciates the importance of health and bacterial diversity, but why don't people attend to the microbiome as an extension of that?


This space is going to make a select few *a lot* of money. The factors for success are all there: a paucity of competition, an almost infinite abundance of data, simple means of data collection, and a demonstrated role in domains relevant to health and disease... These are fertile grounds for discovery and the intrepid pioneers that get in early will no doubt be rewarded.

*Let not thy wastewater be wasted*... You heard it here first.


><sup>†</sup>I can name a couple good companies that recognize this systemic short-sightedness: [Pendulum Therapeutics](https://pendulum.co/) and [Gingko Bioworks](https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/). For the interested reader, I also recommend looking into [Richard Sprague](https://richardsprague.com/microbiome/), who has a pretty extensive passion project on his own microbiome
