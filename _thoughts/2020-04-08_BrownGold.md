# Brown Gold: How our poop is the most untapped gold mine of the 21st Century
Wastewater is a data source that will be replenished each minute of every hour of every day until the end of civilization. The microbiome is *severely* underappreciated in medicine and health (thankfully there are a few companies who recognize this systemic short-sightedness. Check out: [Pendulum Therapeutics](https://pendulum.co/) or [Gingko Bioworks](https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/)).
I've always wondered about this... The evidence supporting the significance of the microbiome is insurmmountable ([Alzheimer's](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0227-7), [longevity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6051225/), [obesity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5082693/), [autism](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00198-y). The list goes on...), so how the hell could this be almost universally overlooked?

Most recently, [researchers have discovered](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00973-x) that sewage water serves as a useful proxy for the extent of COVID-19 infections. This made me wonder: why haven't we done this before?
So what we have is a fundamental misalignment in the current and actual values of this asset (poop). Call it arbitrage or just plain old opportunityâ€”the reality is clear.
Wastewater is literally the shit that no one wants (most people*, since it does have its [uses](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/wastewater-treatment-water-use?qt-science_center_objects=0#)), and so collecting
samples to extract meaningful insights really doesn't perturb the existing system too much.

###### Okay, these might not be the most convincing data, but it's a start... Clearly the public appreciates the importance of gut health and bacterial diversity, but why don't people attend to the microbiome as an extension of that?


This space is going to make a select few people a lot of money. The factors for success are all there: a paucity of competition, an almost infinite abundance of data, simple means of data collection... These are fertile grounds for discovery and the intrepid pioneers that get in early will no doubt be rewarded.

Let not wastewater become wasted... You heard it here first.
