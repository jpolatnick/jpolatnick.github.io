## Perspective

I find perspective to be the most important component of life and philosophy. 

#What is perspective?

Perspective is your understanding of self as it relates to life, the universe, spirituality or whatever you decide to believe in. Your perspective is the single most powerful tool for happiness, success, relationships and everything in between.

#How can we train our own perspective?

1. Learn to control your emotion.
2. Natural world
3. The little things

Marcus Aurelius and the philosophic thought of stoicism have been great intellectual resources that have aided my learning of controlling emotion (see 'books' for more).

Take this Marcus Aurelius quote for example, "Erase the false impressions from your mind by constantly saying to yourself, I have it in my soul to keep out evil, desire, or any kind of disturbance - this is the power nature gave you." This is from Aurelius "Meditations", which is his personal journal for reflection. Aurelius is reminding himself that the mind is the derivitive of your decisions and feelings. The power that nature gives you is the ability to control those things. Practice controlling your emotions to further your morality.


Actively seek cosmic synchronization; that transcendental experience that makes ego impossible and fear pointless. Cosmic synchronization is my fancy way of talking about those moments when you are overlooking a sunset over the ocean, breathing in mountain air, overlooking the dolomites in Italy.... moments where the the serenity of nature are so moving that you enjoy peace and mental refreshment. 


Why be afraid to do anything?

Somewhere up in space, a star has just used all of its combustible hydrogen. What remains is no longer supported by the heat of the combustion and collapses under its own weight to a point where it bends space to such a degree is it plummets into an actual hole￼. This is what we call a black hole...
