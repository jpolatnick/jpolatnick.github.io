## [Fig Finance](http://fig.finance)
<img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="{{site.imgurl}}/fig.png" width="25%"/>

Fig is a side project I started with my best friend to address the growing discrepancy between financial literacy and the accessibility of investing. We wanted to create a "Bloomberg terminal for Robinhood users". Ironically, while Robinhood has done a lot to democratize investing, they've done almost nothing to increase financial literacy, resulting in amateur investors losing a lot of hard-earned money. We're building a dashboard that offers investment data in a simple, clean interface.

The other arm of Fig is the automated trading platform, which scrapes the positions that Wall St.'s top analysts are taking and makes trades based on those positions in real-time. The portfolio is currently in the negative but we deployed it only 2 weeks ago and are looking for value stocks, not just fast-and-easy small gains.

Check out an interactive protoype for our dashboard [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/LxN81yj7stf3tg5fHbHhS4/Web-App-Prototype?node-id=5%3A42&scaling=min-zoom) and a sneak peek at a very (very!) alpha version of the actual dashboard [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16PrnHMCN_JaHgFPBGHLLkxsAyTY3ydXb/view). Fig is still nascent and we've yet to iron out a solid vision for what it will look like.

## [Speech-to-speech voice conversion](https://audioapp.co/)
<img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="{{site.imgurl}}/ellen.gif" width="30%" />

"aud.io" is an automated system for speech-to-speech voice conversion. Want to speak as Spongebob? Donald Trump? Ellen Degeneres and more? Look no further. 

You simply speak into the microphone and out comes the same audio, only your voice is now that of your selected speaker. It can learn new output with a day of training and is robust to pretty much any input you throw at it. Its technology is bordering on the frontier of what is out there and is certainly the only readily implementable platform for social purposes. Part of the tournament for the online accelerator [Pioneer](https://pioneer.app).

## [Analyzing rideshare data](https://medium.com/@skm440/analyzing-rideshare-data-a7c83f95cd65)
<img style="float: right; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="{{site.imgurl}}/map.gif" width="65%" />

I explored the possibility of developing an app that would help rideshare drivers receive bigger payouts for their rides. Since drivers are constantly shifting between rideshare services (always trying to maximize their profits based on surge prices, percent payouts, and general pricing models for each service), I thought to build an app that would put this maximization problem into a quantitative framework. Given the time of day, the driver's location, and other factors (like the weather), which service would be most likely to be most profitable? While the idea had potential, my analysis of the data ultimately proved there to be too much variance for the service be reliable.

## [Modified labeling system for DeepLabCut](https://github.com/sachaker/deeplabcut_texteam)

The DLC labeling process for whiskers can be laborious and repetitive. This alternative to [DeepLabCut](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0209-y)'s point-and-click labeling allows for rapid labeling of contiguous structures, like whiskers. In this new system, the user drags the cursor along each structure, after which the spline is discretized into a pre-set number of nodes with equal increments along the path. This modification increased our throughput from labeling a frame every minute (at least) to labeling a frame every few seconds. I was very pleased when the [original authors](http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut) of the software at Harvard asked if they could include my code in their latest, official version.
