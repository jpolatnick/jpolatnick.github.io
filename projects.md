## [Analyzing Rideshare Data](https://medium.com/@skm440/analyzing-rideshare-data-a7c83f95cd65)

During the summer of 2019, I explored the possibility of developing an app that would help rideshare drivers receive bigger payouts for their rides. Since drivers are constantly shifting between rideshare services (always trying to maximize their profits based on surge prices, percent payouts, and general pricing models for each service), I thought to build an app that would put this maximization problem into a quantitative framework. Given the time of day, the driver's location, and other factors (like the weather), which service would be most likely to be most profitable? While the idea had potential, my analysis of the data ultimately proved there to be too much variance for the service be reliable.

## [DeepLabCut: Modified Labeling System](https://github.com/sachaker/deeplabcut_texteam/blob/master/Protocols/alternateLabelingGUI.md)
The DLC labeling process for whiskers can be laborious and repetitive. This alternative to DeepLabCut's point-and-click labeling allows for rapid labeling of contiguous structures, like whiskers. In this new system, the user drags the cursor along each structure, after which the spline is discretized into a pre-set number of nodes with equal increments along the path. This modification increased our throughput from labeling a frame every minute (at least) to labeling a frame every few seconds. I was very pleased when the [original authors](http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut) of the software at Harvard asked if they could include my code in their latest, official version.
